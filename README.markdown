# SBT Template for Scala + ANTLR Development

## Usage

1. `sbt new meaisin/antlr4template.g8`
2. Enter name of project when prompted (If name is not capitalised, the starter grammar and scala files will break. The grammar file expects the name of the file to be capitalised, and the name of the grammar file is the name given to the project. These files are only really here for example however, and you will likely either completely delete or rewrite these files anyway).
